# BMCA-pipeline

This repository accompanies [paper citation](). It contains model files, data files, and Jupyter notebooks designed to run Bayesian Metabolic Control Analysis (BMCA) and perform subsequent analyses.

## Installation

To set up the environment:

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BMCA-pipeline.git
   cd BMCA-pipeline
3. Create a conda environment and install the dependencies listed in `env.yml`

## Usage
These notebooks can be used to reproduce the figures in the paper. 
Each Jupyter notebook is set up with specific models and data files. 
Some notebooks omit certain types of data. 
All notebooks contain analysis following the BMCA run. 
Analysis regarding aggregate data are found in notebooks containing "-stats" in their title.
